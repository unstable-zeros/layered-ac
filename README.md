This repository contains the code required to reproduce the results in the
paper "Coordinating Planning and Tracking in Layered Control Policies via
Actor-Critic Learning" by F. Yang and N. Matni.

The experiments can be run with the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder. After
the notebook is run, the results will be stored in the in the `notebooks/run`
and can be visualized and read off by running `tensorboard --logdir
notebooks/run/`.
